# `@raidiant/notifai-protocol`

The public wire contract used by the Notifai CLI and service. It provides
TypeBox schemas and TypeScript types for notification drafts, ordered media
collections, structured source context, REST v1 requests and responses,
status vocabulary, lifecycle hints, and platform capabilities.

```ts
import { CAPABILITIES_V1, validateDraft } from '@raidiant/notifai-protocol'
```

The package has no service implementation or private configuration. Node-only
helpers are available from `@raidiant/notifai-protocol/node`.
