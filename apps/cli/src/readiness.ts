 * `init` and `doctor` used to each carry their own idea of this — a fixed
 * five-step script in one, a flat list of checks in the other — which is two
 * copies of the same knowledge that can disagree, and did: doctor called
 * missing hooks fine while init offered to install them, and only doctor knew
 * what a revoked credential looked like.
 *
 * So the model lives here and both commands render it. `doctor` shows every
 * state at once, because a report is what it is for. `init` walks the same
 * list in order and stops at the first thing standing in the way, because
 * someone handed five tasks does none of them. An agent gets the same states
 * through a third renderer that never prompts.
 *
 * The ordering is a dependency chain, not a preference: there is no point
 * asking the server about devices before there is a credential to ask with,
 * and no point reporting a stale contract to someone who cannot reach the
 * server at all. Assessment stops descending when a prerequisite is missing
 * and marks what follows `unknown` rather than guessing.
